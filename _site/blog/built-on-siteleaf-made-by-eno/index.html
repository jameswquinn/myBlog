  <p>On the blog, some posts are more text-heavy whereas sometimes Erin wants a glorious image header. To make it flexible, we look for an asset with the [meta field] <code class="highlighter-rouge">type</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">hero</code> and display that image above the post excerpt. If there’s no hero image, then the post text displays as normal.</p>
